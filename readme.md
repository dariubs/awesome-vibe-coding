# Awesome Vibe Coding [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A hand-picked collection of tools and references for building software with the help of AI—through prompts, iterations, and exploration.

## Overview

This list focuses on tools and workflows where AI plays a central role in the development process. Instead of traditional coding, this approach emphasizes describing ideas, iterating quickly, and trusting the process—even when you’re not sure where it’s headed.
